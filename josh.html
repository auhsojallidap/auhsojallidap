       <h2>Stream Analysis</h2>
       <h3><br><b>I. Summary of the Stream</b></h3>
       <p><br>The live stream was carried out through the use of Facebook and features gameplay on Roblox played by the streamer. The stream lasted for nearly lasting hour and aimed to showcase interactive gameplay while observing audience engagement during live broadcast.</p>
       
       <p><br>At the beginning of the stream, the group played a horror themed game inspired by "Five Nights at Freddy’s" (FNAF), which focused on suspense driven gameplay and jumpscares. After completing the first segment of the proposed game, the stream transitioned to a game called "Shawarma Kiosk", a  simulation game that offered a lighter and more relaxed experience for the viewers and for the group. This transition helped maintain audience interest and provided variety throughout the stream.</p>
       <p><br>The stream incorporated in-game sound effects and royalty-free audio to steer clear of any possible copyright or DMCA problems. Viewer participation was tracked by monitoring reactions and comments throughout the live broadcast. Overall, the live stream showcased a smooth content progression, suitable audience interaction, and adherence to proper streaming standards.</p>
       
       <h3><br><b>II. Stream Gameplay Analysis</b></h3>
       
       <p><br>This section analyzes and describes the gameplay of the horror game and its content. Beginning with Shawarma Kiosk, this game heavily relied on atmosphere, dialogue and unexpected events creating psychological fear. Slow pacing and the eerie setting built tension, making the players feel uneasy doing simple tasks.</p>
       
       <p><br>On the contrary, Five Nights at Freddy’s gameplay focused more on survival mechanics such as monitoring the surroundings through CCTV, managing limited resources and reacting quickly to threats. This style of gameplay prevented the stream from becoming tedious and made the experience dynamic.</p>
       
       <p><br>The groups reactions, like showing fear, looking confused, or bursting into laughter, significantly added a lot to the fun of the game. Talking to each other was particularly important while playing, especially in those nail biting scenes where they had to give each other warnings or quickly react to sudden frights. Still, there were times when the game slowed down a bit because the players weren't entirely clear on what they needed to do next.</p>
       
       <h3><br><b>III. Stream Improvement Opportunities</b></h3>
       <p><br>While the stream was for the most part successful, yet improvements could be made to increase viewer engagement and increase audience reach. 
       Increasing pre-stream announcements and maintaining a consistent schedule may help interest more viewers</p>
       
       <p><br>The gameplay experience would be significantly enhanced if the objectives were articulated with greater clarity to both players and the audience during specific segments. Emphasizing the goals of each game could contribute to a more seamless flow of the stream and aid in sustaining viewer engagement. Furthermore, viewer interaction could be elevated through the incorporation of interactive elements such as Q&A sessions and mini challenges, thereby rendering the stream more entertaining.</p>
       
       <h3><br><b>IV. Well Done Factors</b></h3>
       <p><br>This section figures out what was done well during the livestream. During the stream, one of the things that was done well was the gameplay, as the streamers played consistently without delay or mistakes. The reactions of the streamers were priceless and realistic, showing that the stream was done smoothly.</p>
       <p><br>Another thing that went well during the stream was the streaming software as the streamers were able to use it easily without any problems. The layout of the stream from the streaming software was perfect and the software itself was used greatly without any errors.</p>
       
       <h3><br><b>V. Root Causes of Negative Viewership Trends</b></h3>
       
       <p><br>The stream’s relatively low viewership, totaling 121 viewers, can be attributed to limited promotional efforts and inconsistent streaming schedules. Promotion was restricted to only two Facebook posts, which limited audience awareness prior to the event. Furthermore, the absence of a fixed streaming time reduced viewer availability. Consequently, the stream reached a smaller audience compared to streams that are consistently promoted and scheduled during peak viewing periods.</p>
